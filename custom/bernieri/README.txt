This folder, 'custom\bernieri', and all its subfolders contain almost all the extra data [1] needed 
to build the custom edition of Workrave for Bernieri Consulting and its installer. If you are 
adapting or want to distribute this edition for purposes other than at the request of Bernieri 
Consulting, you must review COPYRIGHT_WARNING.txt in parent directory 'custom'.

"Workrave Custom Edition for Bernieri Consulting" build directions are in BUILD.txt

[1] Many of this customer's copyrighted logos are not included. Both the program and the installer 
depend on these logos. It is expected you are making this custom build because you either are 
working on behalf of the customer and have these logos, or you are modifying the build files to 
reflect your own business name and logos. If you're doing the latter it's imperative that you 
remove all text and images relating to Bernieri Consulting.
